# Welcome to the LiveSafe Engineering Blog.

We'll be using this blog to share some of the cool things we learn as we work through our day-to-day technical challenges. We'll write about topics ranging from continuous integration/development to experimenting with new design patterns. In short, we'll write down just about anything we find interesting. Hopefully you'll think it's pretty cool too.

On the iOS team, we're transitioning to Swift. As we're learning to think more "Swift-y", we'll be sharing it with you. We'll also be sure to explain how we solve Swift/Objective-C interoperability issues we run into.

Our Android engineers love RXJava and will certainly share some tips and tricks they've learned while using it.

From our Web team, look for a comparison of modern front-end web frameworks. They'll also tell you why Scala+Akka is right for us, and may be right for you too.

On the QA front, we'll show you how we use Jenkins and share some of the things we've learned while testing our mobile apps.

We're excited to have you along for our wild ride.
